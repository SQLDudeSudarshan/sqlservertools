The tool is a free lightweight tool that simplifies the assessment of your SQL Server workloads on premise to determine  system utilization required for right sizing on Amazon RDS.
The tool captures CPU, Memory, IOPS and Throughput utilization based on predefined timeframe and make RDS Suggestion on how to right size on AWS.The tool can be run against a single or multiple MS SQL Server instances.

the Tool can be downloaded from Github 

The Tool can run an automated mode or Manaul :

Automated Assessment 

How does the tool work?
The tool runs from the cmd prompt:

For Sql server authentication:

C:\RDSTools>SqlServerAssessment.bat -auth S -login Sql -Password Password -collectiontime 60

for Windows authentication:

C:\RDSTools>SqlServerAssessment.bat -auth W -collectiontime 60

input Paramter:

auth    . S for Sql server , W for windows Authentication
login   . Sql server login ( if option is 'S')
password . Sql server password ( if option is 'S')
collectiontime . Collectiontime in minutes 
sqlserverendpoint='C:\RDSTools\out\RdsDiscovery.csv'  . Server list to be assessed by defualt the Tool will read the output from rdsdiscovery tool .
options  . 
upload , for manual assessmnet upload ( more about this option , in the manual assessmnet section)
C  , cleanup
T , Terminate the assessment before the collectiontime end .
The Tool will create a Sqlagent Job that will run every minutes to populate 5 tables created in msdb:

Sql_collectnioStatus: this table will have the collection job information, start time finish time and status.
Sql_CPucollection: this table will collect 3 key metrics Sql server CPU utilization, system Idle, and other Process Utilization. All 3 metrics are captured as percentage
Sql_DbIO: this table will capture user DB IO between each collection time (the Delta)
Sql DBIoTotal: this table will capture user DB Total IO (Read, Write)
Sql_MemCollection: the table will capture Sql Server Memory Usage, Sql MaxMemory target, os Total Memory OS Available Memory and PLE (more about those metrics in Appendix A).
You can re-run command C:\RDSTools>SqlServerAssessment.bat -auth S -login Sql -Password Password -collectiontime 60  anytime to check on status and remaining time 

If collection still running the tool will tell you how many minutes is left (Fig 2) otherwise it will generate the output files and recommendation
