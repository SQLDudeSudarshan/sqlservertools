   it means  the sqlserver PS module is not loaded into your system
    To install the PowerShell module for SQl server, first make sure you start PowerShell as admin.
    then run below command separately
      1-Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned

    Once this is done you can verify that  sqlserver module has been successfuly by running blow  command 

    Get-Module -name sqlserver
